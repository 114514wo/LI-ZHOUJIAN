**Project Duration:** Sep. 2020 to Sep. 2023  
**Project Partners:** Ecovacs University-Enterprise Joint Project

## Project Details

1. Utilizing convolutional neural networks for pedestrian detection and tracking in videos
2. Predicting pedestrian trajectories to enable real-time obstacle avoidance for a small car
3. Under the YOLOv4 environment, it allows for quick mapping
4. Autonomous path planning under the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework

## Achievements

Gather complex environmental information, complete autonomous mapping, plan the best path with the A* algorithm, and the system will also use OpenCV to preliminarily recognize pedestrian postures.
