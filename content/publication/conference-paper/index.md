## Abstract

This research addresses the challenging problem of robot navigation in indoor uncertain discrete environments by proposing a reinforcement learning-driven algorithm for rapid path replanning. The algorithm integrates adaptive learning mechanisms that enable autonomous robots to efficiently respond to dynamic environmental changes, obstacles, and uncertainties commonly encountered in indoor settings.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a novel reinforcement learning framework for dynamic path replanning
- Enhanced adaptability to uncertain and changing indoor environments  
- Improved computational efficiency for real-time navigation applications
- Comprehensive evaluation in discrete indoor environment scenarios
