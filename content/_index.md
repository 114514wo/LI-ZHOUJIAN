        My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with particular interests in autonomous driving systems, reinforcement learning algorithms, and large language models.

        I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Robotics at the National University of Singapore, where I explore innovative solutions for intelligent navigation, path planning optimization, and computer vision applications in robotic systems.
        
        Feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities! üòÉ
